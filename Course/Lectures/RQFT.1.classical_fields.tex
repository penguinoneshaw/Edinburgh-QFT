\chapter{Classical Field Theory}
\label{chap:rqft_cft}

\section{Point Particles}
\label{sec:rqft_cft_point-particles}
To develop an idea of Quantum Field Theory, we can work from the classical equivalent. 
This builds from the Lagrangian formulation of particle motion, so that is where we will start. 

We define the Lagrangian, as always, as a map from a particle's position and velocity to a scalar energy quantity
\begin{align*}
  L(q, \dot{q}) &= T(\dot{q}) - V(\dot{q})
\end{align*}
where $T$ is the kinetic energy and $V$ is the potential. 
We can then define a functional, the \emph{action} 
\begin{align*}
  S\qty[L(q, \dot{q})] &= \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L\qty(q(t), \dot{q}(t)) \dd{t}
\end{align*}
which maps the \emph{function} $L(q, \dot{q})$ to a scalar value.
The Principle of Least Action, otherwise known as Hamilton's Principle, posits that if we fix the endpoints of the trajectory, then the actual path taken by a particle is the one which minimises the action. 
For this, we need a definition for the \emph{variation}, a transformation under which 
\begin{align*}
  q^\prime(t) &= q(t) + \var{q}(t)
\end{align*}
such that we can ignore higher order terms. 

It is thus a problem of the calculus of infinitesimals, such that
\begin{align*}
  \var{q}(t_1) &= 0 & \var{q}(t_2) &= 0 \\
  \var{\dot{q}}(t_1) &= 0 & \var{\dot{q}}(t_2)
\end{align*}
and by the standard chain rule for infinitesimals, 
\begin{align*}
  \var{L} &= \pdv{L}{q}\var{q} + \pdv{L}{\dot{q}}\var{\dot{q}}\\
  \var{S} &= \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\pdv{L}{q}\var{q} + \pdv{L}{\dot{q}}\var{\dot{q}} \dd{t}\\
  &= 0.
\end{align*}
We note that due to our boundary conditions, we can use integration by parts to `flip' the time derivative
\begin{equation*}
  \pdv{L}{\dot{q}}\dv{t} \var{q} \mapsto - \dv{t}\qty[\pdv{L}{\dot{q}}] \var{q}
\end{equation*}
because the surface term, $\qty[\pdv{L}{\dot{q}}\var{q}]_{t_1}^{t_2}$, vanishes. 
This gives us the Euler-Lagrange equation of variational calculus,
\begin{equation}
  \dv{t}(\pdv{L}{\dot{q}}) - \pdv{L}{q} = 0 \label{eqn1:euler-lagrange}
\end{equation}
which can itself be used to \emph{define} the functional derivative, which is important in \autoref{part:MQFT}, and is called the \emph{equation of motion}. 
It is also easy to extend \autoref{eqn1:euler-lagrange} to many dimensions, with 
\begin{equation*}
  \dv{t}(\pdv{L}{\dot{q_i}}) - \pdv{L}{q_i} = 0
\end{equation*}
with $i \in \{1, 2, 3 \ldots\}$.

We define generalized or \emph{canonical} momentum, \begin{equation*}
  p_i \equiv \pdv{L}{\dot{q}_i}
\end{equation*}
which is the same as regular momentum if and only if the Lagrangian is quadratic in the velocities, but still defines constants of the motion. 
This in turn leads us to the Hamiltonian using the Legendre transform such that
\begin{align*}
  H\qty(\qty{q_i}, \qty{p_i}) &= \sum p_i \dot{q_i} - L\qty(\qty{q_i}, \qty{\dot{q}_i})
\end{align*}
and we get Hamilton's equations of motion
\begin{align*}
  \vec{\dot{p}} &= -\grad_{\vec{q}} H & \vec{\dot{q}} &= \grad_{\vec{p}} H
\end{align*}
which defines the motion of the particle in phase space.

\begin{example}
  \textbf{Simple Harmonic Motion} of a single particle is defined through the Lagrangian
  \begin{align*}
    L(q, \dot{q}) &= \frac{1}{2} m \dot{q}^2 - \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 q^2
  \end{align*}
  which gives the equation of motion and solutions which we expect when the Euler-Lagrange equation is applied
  \begin{alignat*}{3}
    \ddot{q} + \omega^2 q &= 0 & \quad\implies &\quad& q(t) &= q_0 e^{-i\omega_t} + q_0^\prime e^{i\omega t}.
  \end{alignat*}
  
  The Hamiltonian is
  \begin{align*}
    H(p, q) &= p \dot{q} - \frac{1}{2} m \dot{q}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 q^2\\
    &= \frac{p^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 q^2
  \end{align*}
  where we've used that $p = \pdv{L}{\dot{q}} = m \dot{q}$ to eliminate all of the $\dot{q}$ terms.
  Finally we use Hamilton's equations to derive that $\dot{p} = -m\omega^2 q$. 
\end{example}

\section{Classical Fields}
We define a classical (real) scalar field as the map
\begin{align*}
  \phi : \mathbb{R}^4 \to \mathbb{R}
\end{align*}
such that
\begin{align*}
  L(x, \dot{x}) &= \int \mathcal{L}(\phi, \partial^\mu \phi) \dd[3]{\vec{x}}
\end{align*}
where $\mathcal{L}$ is the Lagrangian \emph{density} and our $x$ is now a Lorentz 4-vector.

\begin{whatmeans}
  In the derivation in \autoref{sec:rqft_cft_point-particles}, we assumed a single particle with inertial mass $m$ which moves through a potential. It is trivial to add more particles so long as they do not interact, as we can add Lagrangians together and get the same results individually by linearity. The Lagrangian density is the infinite limit of this concept --- we now have a generalised co-ordinate at every point in real space. The field represents the state of the system at a point $x$ in spacetime, such as in the most simple case here of the Klein-Gordon field $\phi$. The reality of the situation is that this interpretation doesn't hold for long, as it becomes a lot easier to think in terms of coupled oscillators and standing waves once quantum is introduced.
\end{whatmeans}

We can also define the action using this definition, giving a [non-obviously] Lorentz-scalar value
\begin{align}
  S[\mathcal{L}(\phi, \partial^\mu\phi)] &= \int \mathcal{L}(\phi, \partial^\mu\phi) \dd[4]{x}\label{eqn:rqft_cft_action_4}
\end{align}
with which the same process as the 1D case gives the Euler-Lagrange equation
\begin{align*}
  \pdv{\mathcal{L}}{\phi} - \partial^\mu\qty(\pdv{\mathcal{L}}{(\partial^\mu \phi)}) &= 0
\end{align*}
where we treat each derivative of the field as an independent co-ordinate. 

The canonical momentum generalises via the density to canonical momentum field
\begin{align*}
  \pi(x) &= \pdv{\mathcal{L}}{\partial^0 \phi}\\
  &= \pdv{\mathcal{L}}{\dot\phi}
\end{align*}
which leads naturally to the Hamiltonian
\begin{align*}
  H(x, p) &= \int\mathcal{H}(\phi, \pi) \dd[3]{\vec{x}}\\
  \mathcal{H} &= \pi\dot\phi - \mathcal{L}(\phi, \partial^\mu \phi).
\end{align*}

  \subsection{The Klein-Gordon Field} Extending the definition of a free particle obeying the Schr\"odinger equation to relativistic quantum mechanics yields the Klein-Gordon Lagrangian
  \begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} (\partial_\mu \phi) (\partial^\mu \phi) - \frac{1}{2} m^2 \phi^2
  \end{equation*} 
  where the partial derivative terms are the `kinetic' terms and the second term is the `mass' term.
  We can then derive the Klein-Gordon equation by using the Euler-Lagrange equation\footnote{The derivative with respect to the derivatives is somewhat weird to look at and awkward if you don't know what you're looking at. We have to use the product rule on each of the terms (as the $\partial^\mu \phi$ and $\partial_\mu \phi$) are clearly not independent, but because we can raise and lower the indices without penalty so long as it happens in pairs, it is approximately equivalent to doing $$\pdv{(\partial^\mu\phi)} (\partial^\mu \phi)^2$$ which \emph{does} yield the correct answer with the index in the wrong place in this case but once commutativity becomes a problem, we must be more careful.} such that
  \begin{align*}
    \pdv{\mathcal{L}}{(\partial^\mu \phi)} &= \partial^\mu \phi & \pdv{\mathcal{L}}{\phi} &= -m^2 \phi
  \end{align*}
  which yields
  \begin{align}
    (\partial^\mu\partial_\mu - m^2) \phi &= 0.
  \end{align}

  Handily, the canonical momentum is
  \begin{align*}
    \pi(x) &= \pdv{\mathcal{L}}{\dot\phi} \\
    &= \dot{\phi}(x)
  \end{align*}
  which means that we can very easily derive the Hamiltonian
  \begin{align*}
    \mathcal{H} &= \pi(x) \dot\phi(x) - \mathcal{L}\\
    &= \pi^2(x) - \frac{1}{2}(\pi^2(x) - (\grad\phi(x))^2 - m^2 \phi^2)\\
    &= \frac{1}{2}(\pi^2(x) - (\grad\phi(x))^2 - m^2 \phi^2).
  \end{align*}
  
  \subsection{Maxwell Fields} 
  The Lagrangian for a free electromagnetic field is 
  \begin{align*}
    \mathcal{L} &= -\frac{1}{4}F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}\\
    &= \frac{1}{2}\partial_\mu A_\nu \partial^\nu A^\mu - \frac{1}{2}\partial_\mu A_\nu \partial^\mu A^\nu
    \intertext{where}
    F^{\mu\nu} &= \partial^\mu A^\nu - \partial^\nu A^\mu\\
    A &= (\phi(x), \vec{A}(x))
  \end{align*}
 which has\footnote{$F^{\mu\nu}$ is totally anti-symmetric, which simplifies the derivatives process.} 
 \begin{align*}
  \pdv{\mathcal{L}}{A^\mu} &= 0 & \pdv{\mathcal{L}}{(\partial_\mu A_\nu)} &= -F^{\mu\nu}
 \end{align*}
 such that the Euler-Lagrange equations give
 \begin{align*}
   \partial_\mu \qty(\pdv{\mathcal{L}}{(\partial_\mu A_\nu)}) &= - \partial^2 A^\nu + \partial^\nu(\partial_\mu A^\mu)\\
   &= - \partial_\mu F^{\mu\nu} = 0.
 \end{align*}

 The conjugate momenta,
 \begin{align*}
   \pi^\mu &= \pdv{\mathcal{L}}{\dot{A}_\mu}\\&=-F^{0\mu}
 \end{align*}
present a problem for us as physicists, as $\pi^0 = 0$ due to the antisymmetry of $F^{\mu\nu}$; this means $A^0$ is not actually a dynamical field.
We need a `gauge fixing term' to correct this, which breaks the gauge invariance of $\mathcal{L}$ by adding a Lagrange multiplier to impose the Lorenz gauge constraint
\begin{align*}
  \mathcal{L} &= -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}\lambda(\partial_\mu A^\mu)^2
\end{align*}
which adjusts the Euler-Lagrange equation to
\begin{align*}
  - \partial_\mu F^{\mu\nu} - \lambda \partial_\mu (\partial^\nu A^\mu) &= 0.
\end{align*}
There is subsequently a term introduced into the canonical momentum which incorporates the fix with
\begin{align*}
  \pi^\mu &= -F^{0\mu} - \lambda \partial^\mu A^0\\
  \pi^0 &= - \lambda \dot{A^0} \neq 0.
\end{align*}

This has just been the homogeneous Maxwell fields, however.
If we account for the source term $j^\mu = (\rho, \vec{j})$, we get the Lagrangian
\begin{align*}
  \mathcal{L} &= -\frac{1}{2} F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}\lambda(\partial_\mu A^\mu)^2 - \underbrace{j^\mu A_\mu}_{\text{\tiny source term}}
\end{align*}

\section{Discrete Symmetries}
There are three discrete symmetries which we are interested in:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Symmetry under parity, in which we reverse the direction of the spatial basis. Given as the transformation $P: \vec{x} \mapsto -\vec{x}$.
  \item Symmetry under time reversal. Given by the transformation $T: x^0 \mapsto -x^0$.
  \item Symmetry under charge conjugation, which we will come back to later.
\end{itemize}


Under the parity transformation,
\begin{align*}
 \phi &\mapsto \phi &\partial^\mu \phi &\mapsto \partial_\mu \phi & \implies \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{KG}}\,& \textrm{is invariant}\\
 \pi &\mapsto \pi & \grad\phi &\mapsto -\grad\phi &\implies \mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{KG}}\,& \textrm{is invariant}
\end{align*}
which is good, as it means the Klein-Gordon equation is invariant reflecting physical reality.
By definition, $\phi$ is invariant of the basis on the underlying co-ordinate system. For $\partial^\mu \phi$, we have a 4-vector quantity, so $\partial^\mu \phi = (\dot\phi, \grad\phi)$ maps to $(\dot\phi, -\grad\phi)$, which we have a convenient symbol for, $\partial_\mu \phi$. Finally, as the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian are quadratic in the field terms, they are invariant under $P$.

For time reversal,
\begin{align*}
  \phi &\mapsto \phi &\partial^\mu \phi &\mapsto -\partial_\mu \phi & \implies \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{KG}}\,& \textrm{is invariant}\\
  \pi &\mapsto -\pi & \grad\phi &\mapsto \grad\phi &\implies \mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{KG}}\,& \textrm{is invariant}
\end{align*}
under the same arguments as for parity.
