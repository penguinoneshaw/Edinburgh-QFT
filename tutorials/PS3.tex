   \section{Combinatorial factors --- 1} 

    The term with $V=2$ and $P=3$ in the expansion of $Z[J]$ includes
    contractions that give rise to the following topology: 
    \begin{equation}
      \begin{tikzpicture}[baseline={([yshift=0.2ex]current bounding box.center)}]
        \begin{feynman}
          \vertex (a);
          \vertex [right=of a](b);
          \diagram {
            (a) -- (b),  
            (a) -- [out=80, in=100] (b),
            (a) -- [out=-80, in=-100] (b),
          };
          \vertex [below=0.2em of a] {\(_{x}\)};  
          \vertex [below=0.2em of b] {\(_{z}\)};  
        \end{feynman}
      \end{tikzpicture} 
    \end{equation} 
    Compute the symmetry factor for this diagram. 

    

   \section{Two-point function}  
    
    Write down the expression for the two-point function
    \[
      \langle T \phi(x) \phi(y) \rangle \, ,
    \]
    in the $\phi^3$ theory up to order $g^2$. Find the representation
    of these contributions in terms of Feynman diagrams, and compute
    their symmetry factors.

    
    
   \section{$\phi^4$ theory} 
    
    Consider the $\phi^4$ theory in $D=4$, defined by the Lagrangian: 
    \[
      \mathcal{L} = \frac12 \partial_\mu\phi(x) \partial^\mu\phi(x) 
      - \frac12 m^2\phi(x)^2 
      - \frac{1}{4!} \lambda \phi(x)^4.
    \]
    Compute the mass dimension of the fields, and of the coupling
    $\lambda$. Write down the generating functional for this theory,
    and deduce the Feynman rules. 
    
    Draw all connected diagrams with two and four external legs, up to
    order $\lambda^2$. Compute the symmetry factors for each diagram. 

    Using the relation between $Z[J]$ and $W[J]$, write the connected
    two-point function as a function of ordinary correlators.
